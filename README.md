# AngularFire
This is a project made from a tutorial on Lynda.com that explores the possibilities of a registration system using AngularJS and Firebase from Google. The tutorial provided was using obsolete version of Google Firebase so this one has been modified
to work with the latest Firebase.

Additionally added Facebook login authentication

This is a work in progress personal project.
